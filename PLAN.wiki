 - Make a comment here about this method

== Lilypond ==

* Make Breves work by placing the line differently; calculate the numbers based on widths etc. Reference notes:

 - http://www.lilypond.org/doc/v2.19/Documentation/notation/note-head-styles - note head styles
 - http://lilypond.org/doc/v2.17/Documentation/notation/the-feta-font - note glyph names (e.g. `notehead.s1`)
 - http://www.lilypond.org/doc/v2.18/Documentation/internals/notehead internals (e.g. `duration-log`)
 - http://lsr.di.unimi.it/LSR/Item?id=890 - the coloring here is using a similar approach, and the code could be compared
 - http://www.lilypond.org/doc/v2.18/Documentation/internals/scheme-functions
 - http://lsr.di.unimi.it/LSR/Item?id=617 - custom stencils that do calculation

* Take away the custom code to handle whether we have a patched lilypond or not
* Remove the optional PATH in the Makefile

== Colour Spaces ==

Need to understand:

* Topology and metrics (in a sphere, you can have |AC| < |AB| + |BC| even where ABC is a straight line; what is the nature of this space?)
* Different colour spaces (RGB, HSV, HSL, Lab, CMYK etc) and how they work
* Experimenting with the Munsell hues could be a quick path to a workable solution
* How colour spaces correspond to displays (sRGB etc) - gamut etc

== Research Results ==

* Document the fact that CIELAB* has been discovered to not yield uniform perceptual distances over larger distances
* Document CIEDE2000 and CIECAM02, and the distance metrics on them

 - http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/col.1049/abstract
 - Already have code to calculate deltas using colormath library

* Reference the attempts to create color spaces with Euclidean distance functions based on them:

 - A Perception-based Color Space for Illumination-invariant Image Processing at http://gvi.seas.harvard.edu/paper/perceptionbased-color-space-illuminationinvariant-image-processing
 - Constructing Euclidean Color Spaces based on Color Difference Formulas at http://www.idd.tu-darmstadt.de/media/fachgebiet_idd/forschungdienstleistung/color/publikationen_6/constructingeuclideancolorspacesbasedoncolordifferenceformulas.pdf

* Note the existence of sample data based on human experimental difference perception (RIT-Dupont, Witt, Qiao) referenced in the above papers, and the large % error that accumulates even in the above spaces compared to that sample data
* Also note the perceptual non-uniformity of hue as saturation increases etc including

 - The Abney Effect at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abney_effect
 - The Helmholtz-Kohlrausch effect
 - Color constancy with differing illumination levels
 - Contextual effects such as Bartleson Breneman

* Try and use the Jab colorspace of CIECAM02 - see https://github.com/igd-geo/pcolor/ for a Java implementation, and https://github.com/jetspeed/ciecam for a Python implementation

* Research whether there's a sufficient experimental sample data set to construct the set of 12 colors directly from the sample data
