== Colour Spaces ==

Need to understand:

* Topology and metrics (in a sphere, you can have |AC| < |AB| + |BC| even where ABC is a straight line; what is the nature of this space?)
* Different colour spaces (RGB, HSV, HSL, Lab, CMYK etc) and how they work
* Experimenting with the Munsell hues could be a quick path to a workable solution
* How colour spaces correspond to displays (sRGB etc) - gamut etc

== Research Results ==

* Document the fact that CIELAB* has been discovered to not yield uniform perceptual distances over larger distances
* Document CIEDE2000 and CIECAM02, and the distance metrics on them

 - http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/col.1049/abstract
 - Already have code to calculate deltas using colormath library

* Reference the attempts to create color spaces with Euclidean distance functions based on them:

 - A Perception-based Color Space for Illumination-invariant Image Processing at http://gvi.seas.harvard.edu/paper/perceptionbased-color-space-illuminationinvariant-image-processing
 - Constructing Euclidean Color Spaces based on Color Difference Formulas at http://www.idd.tu-darmstadt.de/media/fachgebiet_idd/forschungdienstleistung/color/publikationen_6/constructingeuclideancolorspacesbasedoncolordifferenceformulas.pdf

* Note the existence of sample data based on human experimental difference perception (RIT-Dupont, Witt, Qiao) referenced in the above papers, and the large % error that accumulates even in the above spaces compared to that sample data
* Also note the perceptual non-uniformity of hue as saturation increases etc including

 - The Abney Effect at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abney_effect
 - The Helmholtz-Kohlrausch effect
 - Color constancy with differing illumination levels
 - Contextual effects such as Bartleson Breneman

* Research whether there's a sufficient sample data set to construct the set of 12 colors directly from the sample data
