<h3>Color Theory</h3>

<p>Human vision and color are a very complex topic, and much useful material has been written about them - I would recommend <a href="http://www.handprint.com/LS/CVS/color.html">Bruce MacEvoy's color vision site</a> and <a href="http://www.huevaluechroma.com/index.php">The Dimensions of Colour by David Briggs</a> as both having fairly broad and well-written information. A brief simplified summary of some relevant information follows:
    <ul>
        <li>Light itself can be modeled as a <b>spectrum</b> - a set of amplitudes at different frequencies. Human perception of that light happens on multiple levels.</li>
        <li><b>Our eyes</b> focus light onto a complex distribution of different cells that then produce <b>signals to the brain</b> indicating how much light has been received; these cells respond to different frequencies of light in different amounts, but the colour information transmitted is <b>inherently three-dimensional</b>, with three different ranges of sensitivity that correspond roughly to Red Green and Blue</li>
        <li>Our <b>brain's perception</b> of the appearance of objects is influenced by the level of light in general, our perception of the illuminating/ambient light, and the juxtapositioning of colours</li>
        <li>Standard <b>screens</b>, TVs etc reproduce colours using three wavelengths of light that stimulate the Red Green and Blue receptors in our eyes, but are not able to reproduce the full <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamut">gamut of colours</a> our eyes can see. Colour <b>printing</b> reproduces colours subtractively by combining (minimally) Cyan, Magenta, Yellow and Black ink, and has its own limitations.</li>
        <li>Different <b>colour spaces</b> are used in software to represent colours, and make it possible to analyze the various different <b>properties</b> of colour, including hue, saturation, lightness, chromaticity, chroma, luminosity, brightness and more.</li>
        <li>The <b>shape</b> (or topology) of these color spaces varies; they are generally three-dimensional, and vary between cubic (RGB), cylindrical (HSV/HSL), and irregular shapes (La*b*'s set of colours that humans can perceive corresponds to a kind of distorted cube)</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h4>Equidistant Rainbow Colours</h4>

<p>Given the structure of the musical tone space, it would be useful to have a set of 12 colours that are spaced relatively evenly. The concept of Hue is useful for this purpose as it represents a perceptually continuous cycle along the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_color">spectral colours</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_of_purples">line of purples</a> on a chromaticity diagram. This section will explore how to produce an optimal set of colours with evenly distributed hues.</p>
