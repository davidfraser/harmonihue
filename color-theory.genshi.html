<h3>Color Theory</h3>

<p>Colors can also be modeled using "spaces". Two simple ways are through the RGB color space (which comprises the levels of red, green, and blue light that our eyes perceive), and through the HSV color space which rather uses the dimensions of Hue, Saturation and Value. A more sophisticated kind of color space is represented by the CIELAB color space, in which the distance between points in the space corresponds directly to the perceived difference between the colors to a human viewer.</p>

<h4>Topology</h4>

<p>The color spaces are generally three-dimensional (given the three different kinds of cone cell receptors in the human eye, with sensitivies to different ranges of frequences), and are approximately cylindrical, spherical or cubic depending on the nature of the model:<br/>
  <ul>
    <li>The <b>RGB</b> color space is <b>cubic</b> - each component varies from 0 to 1</li>
    <li>The <b>HSV</b> color space is <b>cylindrical</b> - the Hue component is circular (cycling around the colors of the rainbow), the Saturation value is usually taken from the center of the cylinder to the edge, and the Value parameter as from the bottom to the top of the cylinder</li>
    <li>The <b>Lab</b> color space can handle colors outside the human range of perception; the range of values meaningful to humans corresponds to a kind of distorted cube</li>
  </ul>
