== Book ==

The main current focus is `book.genshi.html`. This is the source template for the documentation. It comprises of a [http://www.genshi.org/ genshi] template for a HTML page that is then processed by lilypond to include musical score. The Python code used to generate the diagrams and tables in the template is located in `book_helpers.py`. To compile the book run `./make-book` - the book is then produced in `out/book.html` with associated files that are required.

=== Dependencies ===

Compiling the book requires:
* Python 2, and the following Python modules:
** genshi
** matplotlib (with a backend that can produce image files)
** mplot_toolkits.mplot3d
** numpy
** decorator
** colormath
* Lilypond for rendering sheet music
* Inkscape for converting SVG (vector) images to PNG (rendered)
* Make for running the process

On Ubuntu 22.04, the following should work:
```
sudo apt install python2.7 python-tk virtualenv python2-pip-whl python2-setuptools-whl 
sudo apt install lilypond
sudo apt install inkscape
sudo apt install make
```

Then from the `harmonihue` directory:
```
virtualenv --python=`which python2` venv/
. venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
make
```
